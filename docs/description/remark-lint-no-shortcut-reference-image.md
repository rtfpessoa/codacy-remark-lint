Warn when shortcut reference images are used.

  Shortcut references render as images when a definition is found, and as
  plain text without definition.
  Sometimes, you donâ€™t intend to create an image from the reference, but this
  rule still warns anyway.
  In that case, you can escape the reference like so: `!\[foo]`.
