Check fenced code block flags.

  Options: `Array.<string>` or `Object`, optional.

  Providing an array is as passing `{flags: Array}`.

  The object can have an array of `'flags'` which are allowed: other flags
  will not be allowed.
  An `allowEmpty` field (`boolean`, default: `false`) can be set to allow
  code blocks without language flags.
