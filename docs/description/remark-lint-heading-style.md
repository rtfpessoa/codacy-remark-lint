Warn when a heading does not conform to a given style.

  Options: `'consistent'`, `'atx'`, `'atx-closed'`, or `'setext'`,
  default: `'consistent'`.

  `'consistent'` detects the first used heading style and warns when
  subsequent headings use different styles.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  formats headings as ATX by default.
  This can be configured with the
  [`setext`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionssetext)
  and
  [`closeAtx`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionscloseatx)
  options.
