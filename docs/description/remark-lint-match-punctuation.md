Warn when punctuations are not matched. For example, when there is only left parenthesis without
right parenthesis, or when right parenthesis is before left parenthesis.

Only punctuations with left/right difference will be included to check, such as Chinese quotation
marks, parenthesis, angle quotes, etc. Currently, plugin will check the usage of following
punctuation:

`“”`, `『』`, `（）`, `《》`, `「」`, `【】`, `‘’`
