Warn for violating fenced code markers.

  Options: `` '`' ``, `'~'`, or `'consistent'`, default: `'consistent'`.

  `'consistent'` detects the first used fenced code marker style and warns
  when subsequent fenced code blocks use different styles.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  formats fences using ``'`'`` (grave accent) by default.
  Pass
  [`fence: '~'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsfence)
  to use `~` (tilde) instead.
