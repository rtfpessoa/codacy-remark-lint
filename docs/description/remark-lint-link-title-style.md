Warn when link and definition titles occur with incorrect quotes.

  Options: `'consistent'`, `'"'`, `'\''`, or `'()'`, default: `'consistent'`.

  `'consistent'` detects the first used quote style and warns when subsequent
  titles use different styles.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  uses `'` (single quote) for titles if they contain a double quote, and `"`
  (double quotes) otherwise.
