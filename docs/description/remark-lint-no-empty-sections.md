This [remark-lint](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint) rule was created for [free-programming-books-lint](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books-lint) to enforce [free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books) [formatting guidelines](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting).

This rule checks that every `([#]+)heading` has some content. This content can be anything: a lower-level heading, a higher-level heading, text, list, etc. It will warn when it detects an `n`-level heading without content followed by another `n`-level heading.
