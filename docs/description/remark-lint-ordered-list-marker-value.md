Warn when the list item marker values of ordered lists violate a given
  style.

  Options: `'single'`, `'one'`, or `'ordered'`, default: `'ordered'`.

  When set to `'ordered'`, list item bullets should increment by one,
  relative to the starting point.
  When set to `'single'`, bullets should be the same as the relative starting
  point.
  When set to `'one'`, bullets should always be `1`.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  retains the number of the first list item bullet, and by default
  increments the other items.
  Pass
  [`incrementListMarker: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsincrementlistmarker)
  to not increment further list items.
