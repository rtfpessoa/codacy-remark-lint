Warn when code blocks do not adhere to a given style.

  Options: `'consistent'`, `'fenced'`, or `'indented'`, default: `'consistent'`.

  `'consistent'` detects the first used code block style and warns when
  subsequent code blocks uses different styles.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  formats code blocks using a fence if they have a language flag and
  indentation if not.
  Pass
  [`fences: true`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsfences)
  to always use fences for code blocks.
