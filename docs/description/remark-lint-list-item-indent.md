Warn when the spacing between a list item’s bullet and its content violates
  a given style.

  Options: `'tab-size'`, `'mixed'`, or `'space'`, default: `'tab-size'`.

  ## Fix

  [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
  uses `'tab-size'` (named `'tab'` there) by default to ensure Markdown is
  seen the same way across vendors.
  This can be configured with the
  [`listItemIndent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionslistitemindent)
  option.
  This rule’s `'space'` option is named `'1'` there.

  See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
  on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.
